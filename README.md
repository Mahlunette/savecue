A Rails app generated: Savecue is a saving app which turns random and unexpected events and even habits to savings: "something that triggers, something like a cue perhaps"!The user can choose from the list of cue cards: Coffee break, rainy day, big spenda and set a specific amount to move from his account to his saving account any time that these events happen. For example if the user chooses Rainy Day card, every time that rains in their city of choice, a certain amount will be saved in their account. The target users are young people (16+) and differentiator is mixing fun and saving.The challenge was mainly managing time: the app was created in two weeks and there were many features and functionalities that we intended to add but had to tick them off the list.
